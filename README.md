## About the Game

It is a game designed as a gamification tool for different subjects taught at the University of Salamanca. The main objective is to provide students with a different way of explaining and reviewing concepts related to the different subjects.

The game is designed as an escape room, where the user will have to move around the map looking for clues and interacting with the elements to then try to solve a series of problems/questions.
